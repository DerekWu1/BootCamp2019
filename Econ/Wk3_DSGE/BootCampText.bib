	Abstract = {This paper proposes that the time-series data on consumption, income,
	and interest rates are best viewed as generated not by a single representative
	consumer but by two groups of consumers. Half the consumers are forward-looking
	and consume their permanent income, but are extremely reluctant to
	substitute consumption temporarily. Half the consumers follow the
	\&quot;rule of thumb\&quot; of consuming their current income. The
	paper documents three empirical regularities that, it argues, are
	best explained by this medal. First, expected changes in income are
	associated with expected changes in consumption. Second, expected
	real interest rates are not associated with expected changes in consumption.
	Third, periods in which consumption is high relative to income are
	typically followed by high growth in income. The paper concludes
	by briefly discussing the implications of these findings for economic
	policy and economic research.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from

	Abstract = { We propose to apply to the simulation of general nonlinear rational-expectation
	models a method where the expectation functions are approximated
	through a higher-order Taylor expansion. This method has been advocated
	by Judd (1998) and others for the simulation of stochastic optimal-control
	problems and we extend its application to more general cases. The
	coefficients for the first-order approximation of the expectation
	function are obtained using a generalized eigen value decomposition
	as it is usual for the simulation of linear rational-expectation
	models. Coefficients for higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion
	are then obtained by solving a succession of linear systems. In addition,
	we provide a method to reduce a bias in the computation of the stochastic
	equilibrium of such models. These procedures are made available in
	DYNARE, a MATLAB and GAUSS based simulation program. This method
	is then applied to the simulation of a macroeconomic model embodying
	a nonlinear Phillips curve. We show that in this case a quadratic
	approximation is sufficient, but different in important ways from
	the simulation of a linearized version of the model. Copyright 2001

	Abstract = {The Paper provides new tools for the evaluation of DSGE models, and
	applies it to a large-scale New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general
	equilibrium (DSGE) model with price and wage stickiness and capital
	accumulation. Specifically, we approximate the DSGE model by a vector
	autoregression (VAR), and then systematically relax the implied cross-equation
	restrictions. Let delta denote the extent to which the restrictions
	are being relaxed. We document how the in- and out-of-sample fit
	of the resulting specification (DSGE-VAR) changes as a function of
	delta. Furthermore, we learn about the precise nature of the misspecification
	by comparing the DSGE model's impulse responses to structural shocks
	with those of the best-fitting DSGE-VAR. We find that the degree
	of misspecification in large-scale DSGE models is no longer so large

	Abstract = {This paper identifies optimal interest-rate rules within a rich, dynamic,
	general equilibrium model that has been shown to account well for
	observed aggregate dynamics in the postwar United States. We perform
	policy evaluations based on second-order accurate approximations
	to conditional and unconditional expected welfare. We require that
	interest-rate rules be operational, in the sense that they include
	as arguments only a few readily observable macroeconomic indicators
	and respect the zero bound on nominal interest rates. We find that
	the optimal operational monetary policy is a real-interest-rate targeting
	rule. That is, an interest-rate feedback rule featuring a unit inflation
	coefficient, a mute response to output, and no interest-rate smoothing.
	Contrary to existing studies, we find a significant degree of optimal
	inflation volatility. A key factor driving this result is the assumption
	of indexation to past inflation. Under indexation to long-run inflation
	the optimal inflation volatility is close to zero. Finally, we show
	that initial conditions matter for welfare rankings of policies.},
